# SeleniumUC ðŸš€

SeleniumUC is designed for bypassing bot detection using Python. Built on top of [SeleniumBase](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase), SeleniumUC focuses on auto-completion and bypassing bot-detection using SeleniumBase's CDP Mode (Chrome Devtools Protocol Mode). This package leverages the powerful features of SeleniumBase while providing enhanced capabilities for undetected automation.

SeleniumBase CDP Mode is a special mode inside of SeleniumBase UC Mode that lets bots appear human while controlling the browser with the CDP-Driver. Although regular UC Mode can't perform WebDriver actions while the driver is disconnected from the browser, the CDP-Driver can.
